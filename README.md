This theme is not affliated with Emilio Aguinaldo College or Brightspace. I am not responsible if you use this and fail your quizzes or if your device blows up, implodes, flames start shooting from it, starts thermonuclear war, another pandemic, zombie apocalypse, alien invasion, or it kills your neighbor's dog.

# About
Dark theme for EAC brightspace https://eac.brightspace.com

I had always hated the unmodifiable white background of Brightspace. I tried other extensions like [Dark Reader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader) and [Midnight Lizard](https://github.com/Midnight-Lizard/Midnight-Lizard) but they seem to use my limited system resource extensively to process and render good looking, dark themed pages. Hence I made this dark theme overlay to ease my eyes with several help online. Work in progress but useable. 

# Known bugs
* Some text might be illegible
  * Workaround: Disable overlay temporarily to view the text
* Some dropdown menus have white borders
  * Workaround: None yet
* Hyperlinks may not be highlighted
  * Workaround: Look for a change in the cursor shape (changes to hand) or disable overlay temporarily to view the hyperlinks
* Not tested in quizzes 
  * Highly advised to disable the overlay before taking a quiz. (Doesn't have to be disabled when using the Lockdown browser as the quiz will continue in that browser rather than in the browser Stylus is installed)
