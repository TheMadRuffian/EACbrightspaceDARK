# About
I had always hated the unmodifiable white background on Brigtspace. I tried other extensions like [Dark Reader](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader) and [Midnight Lizard](https://github.com/Midnight-Lizard/Midnight-Lizard) but they seem to use my limited system resource extensively to process and render good looking, dark themed pages. Hence I made this dark theme overlay to ease my eyes with several help online. Work in progress but useable. Dark theme for EAC brightspace https://eac.brightspace.com

# Known bugs
* Some text might be illegible
  * Workaround: Disable overlay temporarily to view the text.
* Some dropdown menus have white borders
  * Workaround: None yet
* Hyperlinks may not be highlighted
  * Workaround: Look for a change in the cursor shape (changes to hand) or disable overlay temporarily to view the hyperlinks
 
* Not tested in quizzes. Highly advised to disable the overlay before taking a quiz. (Doesn't have to be disabled when using the Lockdown browser as the quiz will continue in that browser rather than in the browser Stylus is installed)
